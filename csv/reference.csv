506;2006;Engage Books;"The Complete Illustrated Novels of Sherlock Holmes: A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of the Four, The Hound of the Baskervilles & The Valley of Fear (Illustrated)";Sir Arthur Conan Doyle;The Complete Novels of Sherlock Holmes includes A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of the Four, The Hound of the Baskervilles, and The Valley of Fear. Included are illustrations by Sidney Paget, George Hutchinson, James Greig & Charles Kerr. Holmes will need to use his various skills, including a knack at cracking ciphers, an aptitude for acting and disguise, tracking footprints, hand to hand combat, and knowledge of psychology to solve cases involving kidnapping, murder and revenge. Sherlock Holmes is famous for his intellectual prowess and is renowned for his skilful use of deductive reasoning, astute observation, and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Deductive reasoning allows Holmes to impressively reveal a stranger's occupation. Similarly, by studying inanimate objects, he is able to make astonishingly detailed deductions about their owners. This mindset was a major innovation in the field of crime fiction, inspiring authors like Robert J. Sawyer, Neil Gaiman and Stephen King.

7160;2017;LandMark Publications;Patent Claim Construction;LandMark Publications;This casebook contains a selection of 363 decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that address issues stemming from claim construction in patent disputes. The selection of decisions spans from 2005 to the date of publication. For each year, the cases are listed in the order of frequency of citation. The most cited decisions appear first. Claim construction is a question of law reviewed de novo. Claim terms generally are construed in accordance with the ordinary and customary meaning they would have to one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the specification and the prosecution history. Aventis Pharma SA v. Hospira, Inc., 675 F. 3d 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2012) A district court has the discretion to take expert testimony into account in determining the ordinary meaning of a claim term to one skilled in the art. Because extrinsic evidence can help educate the court regarding the field of the invention and can help the court determine what a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand claim terms to mean, it is permissible for the district court in its sound discretion to admit and use such evidence. Ibid. The district court committed error when it relied on extrinsic evidence that contradicted the patent's specification, including the claims and written description. Extrinsic evidence may be useful to the court, but it is unlikely to result in a reliable interpretation of patent claim scope unless considered in the context of the intrinsic evidence.The patent specification is the primary resource for determining how an invention would be understood by persons experienced in the field. Advanced Fiber Technologies Trust v. J & L Fiber, 674 F. 3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2012)
